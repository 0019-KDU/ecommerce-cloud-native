## Project Resources for Microservices Architecture

### 1. **Infrastructure Resources**

To set up the infrastructure for your microservices-based system, you'll need the following resources:

- **Kubernetes Cluster**: For container orchestration, managing deployment, scaling, and maintaining the Spring Boot microservices.
  - Tools: AWS EKS, Azure AKS, or Google GKE
  - Alternative: Docker Swarm or Amazon ECS
- **Docker**: For containerizing all Spring Boot microservices and their dependencies.
  - Tools: Docker CLI, Docker Desktop
- **Cloud Provider**: For hosting and scaling your applications.
  - Options: AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud
  - Services: EC2, S3 for storage, RDS for database management

Additional Infrastructure Tools:
- **Terraform or AWS CloudFormation**: For Infrastructure as Code (IaC) management.
- **Nginx or Traefik**: As a reverse proxy and load balancer.

### 2. **Application Resources**

- **Spring Boot Microservices**: For Customer, Product, Order, Payment, and Notification services.
- **Eureka Server**: For service discovery and registration.
- **Config Server**: For centralized configuration management.
- **Kafka**: For message brokering and asynchronous communication.
- **Zipkin**: For distributed tracing and monitoring.
- **MongoDB**: For storing customer and notification data.
- **PostgreSQL**: For storing product, order, and payment data.

### 3. **Development Resources**

- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio Code, or Eclipse.
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub.
- **API Client**: Postman or Insomnia for API testing.
- **Container Management**: Docker Desktop and Kubernetes Dashboard.
- **Build Tools**: Maven or Gradle for Spring Boot applications.

### 4. **Monitoring and Logging Resources**

- **Prometheus**: For application metrics monitoring.
- **Grafana**: For visualization of metrics.
- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**: For centralized logging and analysis.
- **Zipkin**: For distributed tracing.

### 5. **Security Resources**

- **Spring Security**: For authentication and authorization.
- **OAuth 2.0 / JWT**: For token-based authentication.
- **API Gateway**: To enforce security, rate limiting, and routing.
- **AWS WAF**: For additional web application protection.

---

### 6. **CI/CD Resources**

- **GitHub Actions**: For building and testing microservices.
- **Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD**: For managing pipelines.
- **Docker Hub or ECR**: For storing container images.
- **Kubernetes Deployments**: Using Helm charts or Kubernetes manifests.

---

### 7. **Testing Resources**

- **JUnit and Mockito**: For unit and integration testing.
- **Postman**: For API testing.
- **K6 or JMeter**: For load testing.
- **TestContainers**: For container-based integration testing.

---

### 8. **Documentation Resources**

- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: For API documentation.
- **Confluence or Notion**: For internal documentation.
- **JIRA or Trello**: For task management and progress tracking.
